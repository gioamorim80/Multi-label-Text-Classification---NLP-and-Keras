# NLP-Classifying-Complex-Questions
This project applies Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning to help make Q&amp;A Systems more human-like

This project was inspired by the Kaggle competition Google QUEST Q&A Labeling - https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-quest-challenge/overview

In our approach, we define our business problem as a stakeholder who is concerned with classifying questions asked by its users online on several different qualitative aspects. We want our algorithms to get better at understand when a question is complex and would likely demand a human answer instead of a machine-generated answer. For example, when a user is asking a question that is factual, most npl algorithms can do a good job answering it, but if the user is seeking an opinion-based answer then the stakeholder would like to have a customer representative answer it. 

Such algorithm would help the business deal with an influx of consumer-generated questions by filtering and prioritizing questions in order to provide the best possible answers quickly.

To achieve this, we use some of the data made available on the Kaggle competition above. We use Natural Language Processing libraries and tools, such as NLTK and GloVe Word Embeddings, and then apply machine learning and neural networks in order to solve for our multi-class, multi-label classification task.
